# Assmeblyx86_BattleShips
General! Enemy ships in sight.  
- Command how far from water should we get
  - Input a small number, you are too close to the water and enemy ships. EASY TARGET!
  - Input a large number, you are too far, the missles will miss the targets. MISSION FAILED, WE'LL GET IT NEXT TIME

# Instalation
